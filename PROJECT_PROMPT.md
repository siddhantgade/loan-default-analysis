# Project Prompt — Loan Default Capstone

## Goal
Build a complete, polished portfolio project for LinkedIn, GitHub, and interviews in Europe.  
Deliverables:  
- GitHub repo (clean, reproducible, with commit history)  
- LinkedIn post  
- Dashboards in Power BI + Tableau  
- Excel summary workbook  
- Interview prep material (behavioral + technical)  

## GitHub Rules
- Use feature branches, small atomic commits, clear messages.  
- Tag milestones (e.g., v0.1-day1).  
- Raw data in `/data/raw/` ignored via `.gitignore`; only safe samples committed.  

## Tutorial Integration
Following 11-hour YouTube tutorial as backbone, but adapting to our dataset.  
Stop at each step to explain **why** it’s done, link to interviews, and add improvements.  

## Privacy & Fairness
- No PII in repo; anonymize samples.  
- Document fairness checks (bias by demographic groups) later.  

## End Goal
A portfolio-ready capstone that demonstrates:  
- SQL + Python data pipeline  
- EDA & feature engineering  
- Dashboard storytelling  
- Awareness of GDPR/privacy  
- Interview-ready talking points
