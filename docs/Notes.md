Loan term analysis

Employee length analysis

Loan purpose analysis

Home ownership analysis

(Queries written and verified in SQL, connected with Power BI.)



üîó Power BI Setup

Created loan\_performance\_dashboard.bi and connected to SQL database.



Data quality check in Power Query ‚Üí used Column Quality view.

Example: emp\_title is empty in some cases ‚Üí expected, since not all applicants work or disclose employer.

Power Query preview only shows 1,000 rows (default sampling).

üìÖ Date Table \& Time Intelligence

Created a Date Table using the CALENDAR function with min/max from dataset.

Ensured no duplicate rows (Date is primary key).

Added month column:

Month = FORMAT('Date Table'\[Date], "mmmm")



Relationship: One-to-many from bank\_loan\_data\[issue\_date] ‚Üí Date Table\[Date].



This allows proper Time Intelligence functions (DAX).



üìê DAX Measures

PMTD Loan Applications

= CALCULATE(\[Total Loan Applications],
DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date Table'\[Date], -1, MONTH)))



MoM Loan Applications Growth

= (\[MTD Loan Applications] - \[PMTD Loan Applications])
/ \[PMTD Loan Applications]



(Same approach can be extended to funded amount, amount received, interest rate, etc.)

üé® Dashboard Formatting

Canvas background: reduce transparency to 0%.

To manage layering ‚Üí use Format ‚Üí Send Backward/Forward.

üìå Key Learnings \& Takeaways

Always create a dedicated Date Table for time intelligence (instead of relying on raw date fields).

Model View relationships are crucial ‚Üí ensure correct one-to-many mapping.

Use MTD, PMTD, MoM DAX measures for trend analysis.

Power Query preview is limited (1000 rows), but calculations/visuals still run on full dataset.

Data quality issues (e.g., emp\_title blanks) are not errors, but expected domain realities.

4\) Slicers \& Loan Status Concepts



\### Slicers in Power BI

\- Act as \*\*interactive filters\*\* ‚Üí translate user selection into `WHERE` conditions in queries.

\- Best used with \*\*categorical fields\*\* (`address\_state`, `grade`, `purpose`).

\- Cross-filtering must be enabled to ensure slicers affect all visuals consistently.

\- Dropdown slicers save space, checkbox/list slicers improve visibility.



\### Loan Status Analysis

\- Three core categories in the dataset: \*\*Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off\*\*.

\- \*\*Good Loans = Fully Paid + Current\*\*, \*\*Bad Loans = Charged Off\*\*.

\- Ratios are key metrics for portfolio quality:  

&nbsp; `Good Loan % = Good Loans / Total Loans`  

&nbsp; `Bad Loan % = Charged Off / Total Loans`.



\### Good vs Bad Loan Visuals

\- Donut charts highlight % share of Good vs Bad loans.

\- Supporting metrics (Applications, Funded Amount, Received Amount) give context.

\- Ensures stakeholders can see both \*\*proportion\*\* and \*\*absolute values\*\*.



\### Loan Status Table

\- Provides detailed breakdown with aggregations:  

&nbsp; - Loan Applications (COUNT)  

&nbsp; - Funded Amount (SUM)  

&nbsp; - Received Amount (SUM)  

&nbsp; - MTD/PMTD metrics  

&nbsp; - Interest Rate \& DTI (AVG)

\- Serves as a validation layer against KPI cards.



\### Key Learning

\- Slicers + status breakdown turn a static report into an \*\*interactive dashboard\*\*.

\- Always confirm slicers map to fields indexed or properly joined in SQL for performance.

\- Concept of ‚ÄúGood vs Bad‚Äù segmentation is directly tied to business insights (default risk).

## Day 5 ‚Äî Dashboard Enhancements, Sorting & Navigation

### 1. Format Painter
- Speeds up development by copying **visual formatting** (colors, labels, fonts, data labels) from one visual to another.  
- Best practice: finalize design on one KPI/visual ‚Üí apply consistently across the page.  
- Saves time and enforces design consistency ‚Üí key for professional dashboards.

---

### 2. Field Parameters
- Created a **dynamic parameter table** called `Select Measure` with options: *Received Amount*, *Funded Amount*, *Loan Applications*.  
- Used this as the **Y-axis in an area chart** ‚Üí user can switch measures interactively.  
- Concept: **Field parameters** are a modern way to let end-users change visuals dynamically without bookmarks.  
- Interview angle: Compare **Field Parameters vs. Switch DAX**:
  - Field parameters = built-in, scalable, user-friendly.  
  - Switch DAX = older approach, harder to maintain.  

---

### 3. Sorting by Month
- Display issue month as `MMM` (e.g., Jan, Feb) for cleaner X-axis.  
- Problem: by default, Power BI sorts text alphabetically (Apr, Aug, Dec‚Ä¶).  
- Solution: created `MonthNumber` column (1‚Äì12) and used **Sort by Column** ‚Üí sort `MMM` by `MonthNumber`.  
- Interview Q: *‚ÄúHow do you sort months correctly in Power BI?‚Äù*  
  - Answer: Create numeric column for month order ‚Üí `Sort by Column` feature.  

---

### 4. Shape Map Visual
- Added **Shape Map** on overview page ‚Üí visualizes metrics geographically (by borrower state).  
- Customized colors, legends, and titles for clarity.  
- Note: Shape Map is a **preview feature** ‚Üí must be enabled in Options ‚Üí Preview features.  
- Useful for **geospatial insights** like loan distribution by state.  

---

### 5. Donut Chart
- Added to overview page for Good vs Bad loan distribution.  
- Customized **rotation, slice size, color themes, labels**.  
- Best practice:  
  - Keep slice count < 6 for readability.  
  - Use **donut hole** for totals or % values.  
- Interview angle: *When to use donut vs pie chart?*  
  - Donut = better for showing part-to-whole + totals.  
  - Pie = less space for annotation.  

---

### 6. Bar Charts & Treemap
- Built bar charts (e.g., loan count by purpose/grade).  
- Built treemap for loan distribution (hierarchical categories).  
- Bar chart ‚Üí better for exact comparison.  
- Treemap ‚Üí better for relative proportion across categories.  

---

### 7. Edit Interactions
- Used **Edit Interactions** to control how slicers/visuals affect each other.  
- Example: slicer for loan grade filters charts, but doesn‚Äôt affect KPIs.  
- Best practice: prevent irrelevant slicers from confusing users.  
- Interview angle: *How do you manage unwanted slicer effects?* ‚Üí Answer: Edit Interactions.  

---

### 8. Navigation & Layout
- Added **images and navigation buttons** on Page 1 ‚Üí allows multi-page navigation (Overview ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Trends).  
- Buttons can trigger page navigation or bookmarks.  
- Improves **user experience**, makes dashboard feel like an app.  

---

### üîë Key Learnings (Day 5)
- Format Painter & consistent styling ‚Üí dashboard polish.  
- Field Parameters ‚Üí modern, scalable solution for dynamic measure switching.  
- Sorting months requires **numeric column + Sort by Column**.  
- Shape Map ‚Üí geographical loan insights (preview feature).  
- Donut, bar, treemap ‚Üí different strengths, choose based on insight need.  
- Edit Interactions ‚Üí control story flow, reduce noise.  
- Navigation buttons ‚Üí make multi-page reports intuitive.
