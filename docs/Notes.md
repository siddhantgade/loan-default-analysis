(Queries written and verified in SQL, connected with Power BI.)



üîó Power BI Setup

Created loan\_performance\_dashboard.bi and connected to SQL database.



Data quality check in Power Query ‚Üí used Column Quality view.

Example: emp\_title is empty in some cases ‚Üí expected, since not all applicants work or disclose employer.

Power Query preview only shows 1,000 rows (default sampling).

üìÖ Date Table \& Time Intelligence

Created a Date Table using the CALENDAR function with min/max from dataset.

Ensured no duplicate rows (Date is primary key).

Added month column:

Month = FORMAT('Date Table'\[Date], "mmmm")



Relationship: One-to-many from bank\_loan\_data\[issue\_date] ‚Üí Date Table\[Date].



This allows proper Time Intelligence functions (DAX).



üìê DAX Measures

PMTD Loan Applications

= CALCULATE(\[Total Loan Applications],
DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date Table'\[Date], -1, MONTH)))



MoM Loan Applications Growth

= (\[MTD Loan Applications] - \[PMTD Loan Applications])
/ \[PMTD Loan Applications]



(Same approach can be extended to funded amount, amount received, interest rate, etc.)

üé® Dashboard Formatting

Canvas background: reduce transparency to 0%.

To manage layering ‚Üí use Format ‚Üí Send Backward/Forward.

üìå Key Learnings \& Takeaways

Always create a dedicated Date Table for time intelligence (instead of relying on raw date fields).

Model View relationships are crucial ‚Üí ensure correct one-to-many mapping.

Use MTD, PMTD, MoM DAX measures for trend analysis.

Power Query preview is limited (1000 rows), but calculations/visuals still run on full dataset.

Data quality issues (e.g., emp\_title blanks) are not errors, but expected domain realities.



========================================================================================

4\) Slicers \& Loan Status Concepts



\### Slicers in Power BI

\- Act as \*\*interactive filters\*\* ‚Üí translate user selection into `WHERE` conditions in queries.

\- Best used with \*\*categorical fields\*\* (`address\_state`, `grade`, `purpose`).

\- Cross-filtering must be enabled to ensure slicers affect all visuals consistently.

\- Dropdown slicers save space, checkbox/list slicers improve visibility.



\### Loan Status Analysis

\- Three core categories in the dataset: \*\*Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off\*\*.

\- \*\*Good Loans = Fully Paid + Current\*\*, \*\*Bad Loans = Charged Off\*\*.

\- Ratios are key metrics for portfolio quality:  

&nbsp; `Good Loan % = Good Loans / Total Loans`  

&nbsp; `Bad Loan % = Charged Off / Total Loans`.



\### Good vs Bad Loan Visuals

\- Donut charts highlight % share of Good vs Bad loans.

\- Supporting metrics (Applications, Funded Amount, Received Amount) give context.

\- Ensures stakeholders can see both \*\*proportion\*\* and \*\*absolute values\*\*.



\### Loan Status Table

\- Provides detailed breakdown with aggregations:  

&nbsp; - Loan Applications (COUNT)  

&nbsp; - Funded Amount (SUM)  

&nbsp; - Received Amount (SUM)  

&nbsp; - MTD/PMTD metrics  

&nbsp; - Interest Rate \& DTI (AVG)

\- Serves as a validation layer against KPI cards.



\### Key Learning

\- Slicers + status breakdown turn a static report into an \*\*interactive dashboard\*\*.

\- Always confirm slicers map to fields indexed or properly joined in SQL for performance.

\- Concept of ‚ÄúGood vs Bad‚Äù segmentation is directly tied to business insights (default risk).


====================================================================================================================
## Day 5 ‚Äî Dashboard Enhancements, Sorting & Navigation

### 1. Format Painter
- Speeds up development by copying **visual formatting** (colors, labels, fonts, data labels) from one visual to another.  
- Best practice: finalize design on one KPI/visual ‚Üí apply consistently across the page.  
- Saves time and enforces design consistency ‚Üí key for professional dashboards.

---

### 2. Field Parameters
- Created a **dynamic parameter table** called `Select Measure` with options: *Received Amount*, *Funded Amount*, *Loan Applications*.  
- Used this as the **Y-axis in an area chart** ‚Üí user can switch measures interactively.  
- Concept: **Field parameters** are a modern way to let end-users change visuals dynamically without bookmarks.  
- Interview angle: Compare **Field Parameters vs. Switch DAX**:
  - Field parameters = built-in, scalable, user-friendly.  
  - Switch DAX = older approach, harder to maintain.  

---

### 3. Sorting by Month
- Display issue month as `MMM` (e.g., Jan, Feb) for cleaner X-axis.  
- Problem: by default, Power BI sorts text alphabetically (Apr, Aug, Dec‚Ä¶).  
- Solution: created `MonthNumber` column (1‚Äì12) and used **Sort by Column** ‚Üí sort `MMM` by `MonthNumber`.  
- Interview Q: *‚ÄúHow do you sort months correctly in Power BI?‚Äù*  
  - Answer: Create numeric column for month order ‚Üí `Sort by Column` feature.  

---

### 4. Shape Map Visual
- Added **Shape Map** on overview page ‚Üí visualizes metrics geographically (by borrower state).  
- Customized colors, legends, and titles for clarity.  
- Note: Shape Map is a **preview feature** ‚Üí must be enabled in Options ‚Üí Preview features.  
- Useful for **geospatial insights** like loan distribution by state.  

---

### 5. Donut Chart
- Added to overview page for Good vs Bad loan distribution.  
- Customized **rotation, slice size, color themes, labels**.  
- Best practice:  
  - Keep slice count < 6 for readability.  
  - Use **donut hole** for totals or % values.  
- Interview angle: *When to use donut vs pie chart?*  
  - Donut = better for showing part-to-whole + totals.  
  - Pie = less space for annotation.  

---

### 6. Bar Charts & Treemap
- Built bar charts (e.g., loan count by purpose/grade).  
- Built treemap for loan distribution (hierarchical categories).  
- Bar chart ‚Üí better for exact comparison.  
- Treemap ‚Üí better for relative proportion across categories.  

---

### 7. Edit Interactions
- Used **Edit Interactions** to control how slicers/visuals affect each other.  
- Example: slicer for loan grade filters charts, but doesn‚Äôt affect KPIs.  
- Best practice: prevent irrelevant slicers from confusing users.  
- Interview angle: *How do you manage unwanted slicer effects?* ‚Üí Answer: Edit Interactions.  

---

### 8. Navigation & Layout
- Added **images and navigation buttons** on Page 1 ‚Üí allows multi-page navigation (Overview ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Trends).  
- Buttons can trigger page navigation or bookmarks.  
- Improves **user experience**, makes dashboard feel like an app.  

---

### üîë Key Learnings (Day 5)
- Format Painter & consistent styling ‚Üí dashboard polish.  
- Field Parameters ‚Üí modern, scalable solution for dynamic measure switching.  
- Sorting months requires **numeric column + Sort by Column**.  
- Shape Map ‚Üí geographical loan insights (preview feature).  
- Donut, bar, treemap ‚Üí different strengths, choose based on insight need.  
- Edit Interactions ‚Üí control story flow, reduce noise.  
- Navigation buttons ‚Üí make multi-page reports intuitive.

Day 6 ‚Äî Python EDA Notes
Jupyter Notebook Basics

Markdown cells allow formatted text.

# = H1 (largest heading), ## = H2, ### = H3, etc.
Fewer # ‚Üí bigger heading size.
Use Markdown for titles, explanations, and structuring your notebook (recruiter-friendly).

Code cells are for Python; always run from top to bottom for reproducibility.

Reading Data

pd.read_excel(path) ‚Üí loads Excel file into a DataFrame (df).
pd.read_csv(path) ‚Üí use for CSV files (much faster).
Always check file type first; .csv vs .xlsx matters.

Common options:

usecols=[] ‚Üí load only selected columns.
dtype={} ‚Üí force column types on load.
low_memory=False ‚Üí prevents mixed dtypes warning on large files.

Basic Exploration

df.head() ‚Üí first 5 rows (use .head(10) for more).
df.tail() ‚Üí last 5 rows.

Helps confirm data loaded correctly and no parsing issues.

Dimensions

df.shape ‚Üí returns tuple (rows, columns).
df.shape[0] ‚Üí number of rows.
df.shape[1] ‚Üí number of columns.

Use print(f"Rows: {df.shape[0]}, Columns: {df.shape[1]}") for clean output.

Data Types
df.dtypes ‚Üí shows data type of each column.
int64, float64 ‚Üí numeric.
object ‚Üí usually strings (needs cleaning).
datetime64[ns] ‚Üí date/time.

Important for deciding preprocessing: e.g., categorical encoding, datetime parsing.

Descriptive Statistics
df.describe() ‚Üí summary of numeric columns only by default:
count ‚Üí non-missing values.
mean, std ‚Üí average and spread.
min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max ‚Üí quartiles & extremes.

Use df.describe(include='all') ‚Üí includes object/categorical columns (count, unique, top, freq).

Professional Touches
Always start notebooks with imports + data load cell.
Follow with a Quick Info cell: shape, dtypes, describe.
Helps recruiters see you know structured EDA.
Before GitHub: do Kernel ‚Üí Restart & Run All to ensure clean, reproducible outputs.

Day 7 Notes

--> Parsing Dates Correctly (dayfirst vs monthfirst) Can Make or Break KPIs
Issue

In Python (pandas), my issue_date column was showing only 1 row for Dec 2021, even though I could clearly see many December dates in Excel. Because of this, my Month-to-Date (MTD) totals were tiny (~0.01M) instead of ~58M like in SQL/Power BI.

--> Cause

By default, pandas assumes dates are in month-first format (MM-DD-YYYY). But my dataset actually had day-first format (DD-MM-YYYY). This caused pandas to mis-read most December dates and collapse them.

--> Fix (What Worked)

Load the CSV with the correct setting:

df = pd.read_csv(path, parse_dates=['issue_date'], dayfirst=True)

--> Python Quick Notes

To find avg in python we use mean

To comment in python in jupyter we use #

--> Good Loan KPIs
good_loans = df[df['loan_status'].isin(["Fully Paid", "Current"])]

total_loan_applications = df['id'].count()

good_loan_applications = good_loans['id'].count()
good_loan_funded_amount = good_loans['loan_amount'].sum()
good_loan_received = good_loans['total_payment'].sum()

good_loan_funded_amount_millions = good_loan_funded_amount / 1000000
good_loan_received_millions = good_loan_received / 1000000

good_loan_percentage = (good_loan_applications / total_loan_applications) * 100

print("Good Loan Applications:", good_loan_applications)
print(f"Good Loan Funded Amount(in millions): {good_loan_funded_amount_millions:.2f}M")
print(f"Good Loan Received Amount(in millions): {good_loan_received_millions:.2f})M")
print(f"Good Loan Percentage: {good_loan_percentage:.2f}M")

Monthly Funded Amount (Line + Area Chart)
Code
monthly_funded = (
    df.sort_values('issue_date')
      .assign(month_name=lambda x: x['issue_date'].dt.strftime('%b %Y'))
      .groupby('month_name', sort=False)['loan_amount']
      .sum()
      .div(1000000)
      .reset_index(name='loan_amount_millions')
)

plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
x = range(len(monthly_funded))
y = monthly_funded['loan_amount_millions']

plt.fill_between(x, y, color='skyblue', alpha=0.5)

        color='black'
    )
plt.title('Total Funded Amount by Month', fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Funded Amount (In Millions)')
plt.xticks(ticks=x, labels=monthly_funded['month_name'], rotation=45)
plt.grid(True, linestyle = '--', alpha = 0.6)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

--> Explanation
------->Data Prep

df.sort_values('issue_date')

What it does: Sorts the entire DataFrame in ascending order based on issue_date.

Why we do it: Ensures months appear chronologically (Jan ‚Üí Feb ‚Üí Mar) instead of alphabetically (Apr ‚Üí Feb ‚Üí Jan).
.assign(month_name=lambda x: x['issue_date'].dt.strftime('%b %Y'))

What it does: Creates a new column month_name with values like "Jan 2024".

Why we do it: Provides a simple string for grouping by month.

.groupby('month_name', sort=False)['loan_amount']

What it does: Groups rows by month_name, focusing only on loan_amount.
Why we do it: Aggregates all loan amounts within the same month.
Note: sort=False preserves chronological order.

.sum()

What it does: Adds up all loan amounts for each month.
Why we do it: Produces total funded loan amount per month.

.div(1000000)

What it does: Divides monthly totals by 1,000,000.

Why we do it: Converts large numbers into millions for readability.

Example:

issue_date	loan_amount
2024-03-15	250000
2024-02-10	500000
2024-02-28	750000
2024-03-20	1000000

Before .reset_index() (Series output):

month_name
Feb 2024    1.25
Mar 2024    1.25
Name: loan_amount, dtype: float64


After .reset_index(name='loan_amount_millions'):

month_name	loan_amount_millions
Feb 2024	1.25
Mar 2024	1.25

Why .reset_index() is important:

Before: result is a Series (month names = index, sums = values).
After: result is a clean DataFrame (month as column, sums renamed to loan_amount_millions).
Benefits: makes charting easier (explicit x and y columns).

-------> Setup Plot

plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
Creates a new chart canvas, size 10x5 inches.

x = range(len(monthly_funded))
Generates numeric x positions [0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶] for each month.

y = monthly_funded['loan_amount_millions']
Selects monthly totals as y-values.

plt.fill_between(x, y, ...)
Shades the area under the line in skyblue (area chart effect).

plt.plot(x, y, ...)
Draws the line itself (blue, thickness=2).

------->Data Labels

for i, row in monthly_funded.iterrows():
Loops over each row in DataFrame.

i = numeric index (0,1,2‚Ä¶).

row = row data.

plt.text(...)
Adds text annotations above each point.

x-coordinate: i ‚Üí aligns label with month index.

y-coordinate: row['loan_amount_millions'] + 0.1 ‚Üí slightly above point.

Text content: f"{row['loan_amount_millions']:.2f}" ‚Üí formats value with 2 decimals.

------->Styling:

ha='center' ‚Üí horizontal center.

va='bottom' ‚Üí bottom alignment.

fontsize=9 ‚Üí small font.

rotation=0 ‚Üí horizontal text.

color='black' ‚Üí black labels.

------->Titles, Axes & Grid

plt.title(..., fontsize=14) ‚Üí Adds chart title (larger font).

plt.xlabel('Month') ‚Üí Names x-axis.

plt.ylabel('Funded Amount (In Millions)') ‚Üí Names y-axis.

plt.xticks(...) ‚Üí Replaces numeric x-ticks with month names, rotated 45¬∞ for readability.

plt.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.6) ‚Üí Dashed semi-transparent grid.

plt.tight_layout() ‚Üí Adjusts layout to fit labels.

plt.show() ‚Üí Renders chart.

------->Why the Loop?

Matplotlib‚Äôs plt.text() can only annotate one point at a time.
To label all months:
Iterate through each row (iterrows()).
Get x-position (i).
Get y-value (row['loan_amount_millions']).
Place label above point.
Without loop ‚Üí only one label, not per month.

Regional Analysis By State (Bar Chart)
Code
state_funding = df.groupby('address_state')['loan_amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=True)
state_funding_millions = state_funding / 1000000

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
bars = plt.barh(state_funding_millions.index, state_funding_millions.values, color='lightcoral')

for bar in bars:
    width = bar.get_width()
    plt.text(
        width + 1,
        bar.get_y() + bar.get_height() / 2,
        f'{width:.0f}M',
        va='center',
        fontsize=9
    )

plt.title('Total Funded Amount by state (in  Millions)')
plt.xlabel('Funded Amount ($ Millions)')
plt.ylabel('State')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Explanation

df.groupby('address_state')
Groups DataFrame rows by address_state so all loans from the same state are bundled.

['loan_amount'].sum()
Calculates total funded amount per state.

.sort_values(ascending=True)
Sorts states from lowest to highest funded amount. Result = Series (index=state, value=total).

Plotting (plt.barh)
state_funding_millions.index ‚Üí y-axis labels (states).
state_funding_millions.values ‚Üí x-axis values (amounts in millions).
color='lightcoral' ‚Üí bar color.
bars stores bar objects for labeling.

Adding Data Labels (loop)
Iterate for bar in bars: to handle each bar individually.
width = bar.get_width() ‚Üí bar length (value).
bar.get_y() + bar.get_height() / 2 ‚Üí vertical center of bar (places text centered).
plt.text(width + 1, ..., f'{width:.0f}M', va='center', fontsize=9) ‚Üí places integer-million label slightly right of bar end.

Final formatting
Titles and axis labels clarify units. plt.tight_layout() avoids clipping. plt.show() renders the figure.
