DAY 3 Notes



SQL KPI Queries Completed

Total loan applications

Month-to-date (MTD) loan applications

Previous MTD loan applications

Total funded amount (overall + previous month)

Total amount received (overall + previous month)

Average interest rate (overall + previous month)

Average debt-to-income ratio (overall, current month, previous month)

Good loan analysis (applications, % share, funded amount, total received amount)

Bad loan analysis (applications, % share, funded amount, total received amount)

Loan status (overall + current month)

Monthly trend by issue date

Regional analysis by state

Loan term analysis

Employee length analysis

Loan purpose analysis

Home ownership analysis

(Queries written and verified in SQL, connected with Power BI.)



üîó Power BI Setup

Created loan\_performance\_dashboard.bi and connected to SQL database.



Data quality check in Power Query ‚Üí used Column Quality view.

Example: emp\_title is empty in some cases ‚Üí expected, since not all applicants work or disclose employer.

Power Query preview only shows 1,000 rows (default sampling).

üìÖ Date Table \& Time Intelligence

Created a Date Table using the CALENDAR function with min/max from dataset.

Ensured no duplicate rows (Date is primary key).

Added month column:

Month = FORMAT('Date Table'\[Date], "mmmm")



Relationship: One-to-many from bank\_loan\_data\[issue\_date] ‚Üí Date Table\[Date].



This allows proper Time Intelligence functions (DAX).



üìê DAX Measures

PMTD Loan Applications

= CALCULATE(\[Total Loan Applications],
DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date Table'\[Date], -1, MONTH)))



MoM Loan Applications Growth

= (\[MTD Loan Applications] - \[PMTD Loan Applications])
/ \[PMTD Loan Applications]



(Same approach can be extended to funded amount, amount received, interest rate, etc.)

üé® Dashboard Formatting

Canvas background: reduce transparency to 0%.

To manage layering ‚Üí use Format ‚Üí Send Backward/Forward.

üìå Key Learnings \& Takeaways

Always create a dedicated Date Table for time intelligence (instead of relying on raw date fields).

Model View relationships are crucial ‚Üí ensure correct one-to-many mapping.

Use MTD, PMTD, MoM DAX measures for trend analysis.

Power Query preview is limited (1000 rows), but calculations/visuals still run on full dataset.

Data quality issues (e.g., emp\_title blanks) are not errors, but expected domain realities.

4\) Slicers \& Loan Status Concepts



\### Slicers in Power BI

\- Act as \*\*interactive filters\*\* ‚Üí translate user selection into `WHERE` conditions in queries.

\- Best used with \*\*categorical fields\*\* (`address\_state`, `grade`, `purpose`).

\- Cross-filtering must be enabled to ensure slicers affect all visuals consistently.

\- Dropdown slicers save space, checkbox/list slicers improve visibility.



\### Loan Status Analysis

\- Three core categories in the dataset: \*\*Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off\*\*.

\- \*\*Good Loans = Fully Paid + Current\*\*, \*\*Bad Loans = Charged Off\*\*.

\- Ratios are key metrics for portfolio quality:  

&nbsp; `Good Loan % = Good Loans / Total Loans`  

&nbsp; `Bad Loan % = Charged Off / Total Loans`.



\### Good vs Bad Loan Visuals

\- Donut charts highlight % share of Good vs Bad loans.

\- Supporting metrics (Applications, Funded Amount, Received Amount) give context.

\- Ensures stakeholders can see both \*\*proportion\*\* and \*\*absolute values\*\*.



\### Loan Status Table

\- Provides detailed breakdown with aggregations:  

&nbsp; - Loan Applications (COUNT)  

&nbsp; - Funded Amount (SUM)  

&nbsp; - Received Amount (SUM)  

&nbsp; - MTD/PMTD metrics  

&nbsp; - Interest Rate \& DTI (AVG)

\- Serves as a validation layer against KPI cards.



\### Key Learning

\- Slicers + status breakdown turn a static report into an \*\*interactive dashboard\*\*.

\- Always confirm slicers map to fields indexed or properly joined in SQL for performance.

\- Concept of ‚ÄúGood vs Bad‚Äù segmentation is directly tied to business insights (default risk).
